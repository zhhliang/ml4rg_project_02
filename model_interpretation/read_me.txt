Here are the scripts for interpreting the models:

"prepare_data_modisco.ipynb": a python script to select and prepare data for the differential and global motifs analysis.
"modisco_lite.ipynb": a python script to run the modisco-lite for motifs discovery using contribution scores from the cell type specific models.
"locate_patterns_global.ipynb": a python script to plot the sequence using contribution scores to show motifs from the global motif analysis.
"modisco_diff_global_analysis_heatmap.R": an R script to plot heatmaps of the discovered Motifs and TFs in the differential and global motifs analysis.
